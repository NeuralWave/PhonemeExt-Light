# PhonemeExt-Light
Lightweight version of the phoneme extraction network

This network implements the architecture shown in the paper Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks together with Connectionist Temporal Classification for achieving 16.7% PER in the TIMIT TEST phoneme dataset at a low computational cost.
